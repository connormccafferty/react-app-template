# Feature: Channels

This repo is a simple demonstration of the [Channel API](https://cdn.openfin.co/docs/javascript/stable/InterApplicationBus.Channel.html) in an Openfin/React Application. Launching the app creates a channel provider, clicking the Create Channel Client button will create a new window and join the channel as a client upon creation.

### How to use this:

-   Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/connormccafferty/react-app-template`
-   Install the dependencies: `cd react-app-template` & `git checkout feature/channels` & `npm install`
-   Start the live-server: `npm start`
-   Launch the OpenFin application: `npm run start:openfin`
